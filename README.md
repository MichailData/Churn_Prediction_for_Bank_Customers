# Churn Prediction for Bank Customers

Welcome to my Data Science project on A/B Testing Analysis for a Website Survey. The project utilizes a dataset with features for more than 8,000 users of a website, as well as their click-through response to two different versions of a survey. The results of the test are analyzed and evaluated through data exploration, sanity checks and statistical tests. Recommendations are provided on whether is safe and worthy to launch the experimental version "B" of the survey. In addition, a new A/B testing is proposed, and its required sample size is estimated based on the desired statistical power and minimum detectable effect.
